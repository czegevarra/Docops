So hello there!   
  
This is the first post made by Forestry app - CMS like Netlify, which allows user to create content in git-based websites. 

I use Hugo, because it's simple and flexible. 

What I'm going to do next - i"ll find out if there are ways to connect custom domain or use domain from Forestry.   
  
Thanks!
