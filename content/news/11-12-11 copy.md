## So hello there!

_This_ is the first post made by Forestry app - CMS like Netlify, which allows user to create content in git-based websites.

I use Hugo, because it's simple and flexible.

What I'm going to do next - i"ll find out if there are ways to connect custom domain or use domain from Forestry.

Thanks!
